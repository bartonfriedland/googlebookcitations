# googlebookcitations
A simple python programme with UI that allows a user to search for a book on Google books and download a BIBTeX citation. This is useful in my writing process. It took less than an hour and I learned a bit about different options and packages in python in the process.

The citation gets downloaded into the directory that the script is running from.

The programme was created with the help of ChatGPT 4.0.
